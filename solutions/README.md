# Solutions

This directory contains generated output from the orchestrator. It is isolated from the core workspace to avoid conflicts.

## Structure

```
solutions/
├── README.md
└── _staging/       # Active solution workspaces
    └── <request-id>/
        └── README.md
```

## Rules
- Solutions are generated by the orchestrator or MCP server
- Each solution gets a unique request-id directory
- Solutions do NOT participate in pnpm workspace installs
- Apply to platform only when explicitly instructed
