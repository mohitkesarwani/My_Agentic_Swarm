## Purpose

Centralizing external references helps:
- Maintain consistent knowledge across agents
- Track authoritative sources
- Prevent link rot through curation
- Provide context for architectural decisions

## Maintenance

This directory should be reviewed periodically to:
- Update broken links
- Add new authoritative sources
- Remove outdated references
- Ensure relevance to current architecture

## Contributing

When adding new sources:
1. Verify the source is authoritative and maintained
2. Add a brief description of relevance
3. Organize under appropriate category
4. Include version/date information where applicable
