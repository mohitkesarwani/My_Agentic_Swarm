# My Agentic Swarm

Enterprise-grade monorepo for an agent-driven build system. An Orchestrator coordinates specialist agents (frontend, backend, infra, security, data, blockchain/DeFi) to process build requests, generate solutions, and maintain platform quality.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites: Node.js 22+, pnpm, Docker

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env

# Start local services (Mongo + API + Web)
docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Or run in dev mode (requires local MongoDB)
pnpm dev
```

- Troubleshooting common issues

## How the Orchestrator Works

The Orchestrator (`tools/orchestrator`) accepts build requests and coordinates specialist agents. It now supports two modes:

### Basic Mode (Legacy)
1. Parses the request and generates a plan with tasks, owners, and dependencies
2. Proposes architecture options and writes an ADR for the chosen approach
3. Creates solution workspace structure
4. Logs task assignments (agents not invoked)

### Enhanced Mode (New) 🆕
1. **Natural Language Parsing** - Automatically identifies frontend, backend, database, security, and QA requirements
2. **Agent Coordination** - Dispatches tasks to appropriate specialist agents
3. **Dependency Management** - Executes tasks in topological order respecting dependencies
4. **Artifact Handoffs** - Agents share schemas, interfaces, and contracts through structured artifacts
5. **Security & QA Gates** - Code must pass security review and QA validation before promotion
6. **Workspace Isolation** - Each build gets isolated workspace with artifact tracking

Run enhanced mode with:
```bash
node tools/orchestrator/src/index.js <build-request.json> --enhanced
```

See [Orchestrator Guide](./docs/orchestrator-guide.md) and [Agent Workflow](./docs/agent-workflow.md) for details.

### Specialist Agents

**Core**: Frontend, Backend, Data, Security, QA, Infra

**Blockchain/DeFi**: DeFi Product, Smart Contract Engineer, Smart Contract Security, Fuzzing & Invariant Testing, Protocol Risk, Wallet & Key Management, On-chain Off-chain Integration, Oracle & Data Integrity, Compliance & Monitoring

## How the MCP Server Works

The MCP Server (`tools/mcp-server`) provides agent-accessible commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `getRepoMap` | Returns the repository directory tree |
| `getStandards` | Reads API conventions and security standards |
| `getKnowledgeBaseIndex` | Lists all knowledge-base documents |
| `writeADR` | Creates a new Architecture Decision Record |
| `createSolutionWorkspace` | Scaffolds a solution workspace |

## Knowledge Base

Located at `knowledge-base/`, it contains:

- **Engineering standards**: Coding standards, security standards, approved dependencies, blockchain standards
- **Prompts**: Build request plans and prompt templates
- **Product context**: Product requirements and references

## Where Solutions Are Generated

Solutions are generated in isolated directories to avoid workspace conflicts:
- Multi-user mode: `solutions/users/<userId>/projects/<projectId>/builds/<buildRequestId>/`
- Legacy CLI mode: `solutions/_staging/<request-id>/`

Solutions are only applied to `apps/` or `packages/` when a build request explicitly says "apply to platform".

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm install               # Install all workspace dependencies
pnpm build                 # Build all packages
pnpm test                  # Run all tests
pnpm typecheck             # Type-check all packages
pnpm verify                # Run full verification (install, build, typecheck, test)
pnpm repo-health           # Check that all required files exist
```

## Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

Starts: MongoDB 7, API server (port 3001), Web app (port 5173).

## CI/CD

- **ci.yml**: Install → Build → Typecheck → Test on all PRs
- **security.yml**: Dependency audit, secret scanning on PRs + weekly schedule
- **dependabot.yml**: Weekly dependency updates

## Security

- Helmet security headers
- CORS allowlist
- Rate limiting
- Zod input validation
- PII redaction in logs
- Request-ID correlation
- Password-based auth with JWT (see ADR-002)
- OWASP API Security Top 10 mapped in `docs/api/security-checklist.md`
